# My Story in Tech
Kia ora, I’m Daniel Mladek.

My journey into tech has been a steady evolution, fuelled by my curiosity and a desire to always keep learning. I actually started out studying civil engineering, but found that working on construction sites didn’t bring any joy. Instead, I was drawn to computers—my hobby at the time—and taught myself enough to step into the world of IT. My early career began at Sun Microsystems, where I worked as a Quality Assurance Engineer on the NetBeans Java IDE project. That experience sparked my love for Java and Unix ecosystem and set me on a path to becoming a Java developer.

Over time, I’ve taken on a range of IT roles, from software testing to DevOps, before eventually settling into back-end development, creating RESTful APIs and web services. Along the way, I made a big life change. While visiting Aotearoa New Zealand, I fell in love with the country and decided to stay. I rolled up my sleeves and worked on vineyards and farms, adapting to work I’d never done before, and it taught me that I could flourish and enjoy in any environment. This adaptability is something I’ve carried back into tech. When I realised I was missing front-end experience, I turned to Dev Academy’s immersive seventeen-week bootcamp to expand my skill set. Not only did I sharpen my technical abilities in modern JavaScript frameworks like React, but I also improved my communication, feedback, and team-based problem-solving skills.

Now, as a full-stack developer, I can bring value both behind the scenes and at the interface level. I know I can tackle new challenges, learn quickly, and thrive in unfamiliar territory—just as I did when I first arrived in New Zealand. I’m excited about the future, ready to blend my back-end expertise with my new front-end capabilities, and eager to contribute meaningfully to a team that values curiosity, growth, and adaptability.
